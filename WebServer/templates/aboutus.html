			Wearable sensors are becoming less invasive, more 'transparent', more comfortable and consequentially more widespread. The massive use of these technologies allows to acquire a great amount of data to be used to train machine learning algorithms to help clinicians in the phases of monitoring, diagnosis and rehabilitation. In particular, the more sensors become 'invisible', the more they can be used in complex applications, such as sleep tracking. In this way Polysomnography (PSG) still remains the gold standard, but it is now becoming feasible to partially replace PSG with evaluations performed at home by means of a BAN (Body Area Network). All this great amount and different kind of information needs to be archived and standardized, in order to be analysed in a coherent and automatic way. This Thesis aims at developing a prototype that takes data as input from a Web page, so that it is very easy to use. Once data is uploaded, information is standardized and saved in a database. In the end, users can download data, according to FHIR standard. This process can be customized from the final user with some filters from Web interface. Lastly, there is a basic level of security and, moreover, the system is designed to be interoperable and distributed, so that it can be easily updated in the future.
